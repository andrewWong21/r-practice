# 1. What is the difference between subsetting a vector with positive integers,
# negative integers, a logical vector, or a character vector?

# 2. Whatâ€™s the difference between [, [[, and $ when applied to a list?

# 3. When should you use drop = FALSE?

# 4. If x is a matrix, what does x[] <- 0 do? How is it different from x <- 0?

# 5. How can you use a named vector to relabel categorical variables?

# multiple interrelated concepts required to internalize
# in order to master subsetting in R

# six ways of subsetting atomic vectors

# subsetting operators [], [[]], and $

# different interactions of subsetting operators with different vector types
# e.g. atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames

# combining subsetting with assignment - subassignment

# str() shows all pieces and structure of an object,
# while subsetting extracts parts important to current projects
