# R may make in-place modification for optimization or it may not
# R maintains reference counts, counting 0, 1, or many bindings for an object
# removing a binding from an object with 2 bindings
# still results in an object with "many" bindings according to R
# so R may still make copies for objects with only one binding

# calling most functions makes a reference to the object
# primitive C functions found in base package are an exception

# for loops in R tend to be slow due to copies being made each loop

# easy to determine when a copy is being made, hard to prevent it
# rewriting functions in C++ may be a feasible solution to avoid copies

# reference semantics - any existing bindings to a given environment
# continue to have the same reference even after the environment is modified

# garbage collector frees up memory by deleting unused objects
# R uses tracing garbage collector, identifying reachable objects
# from global environment by recursively searching references

# GC runs automatically whenever more memory is needed for new object
# use gcinfo(TRUE) to get messages printed when garbage collector runs

# can force garbage collection with gc(), but not needed
# may be desirable for returning memory to OS for other programs
# or finding out how much memory is currently being used by R
gc()

# lobstr::mem_used() is a wrapper around gc(), prints total bytes used
mem_used()

# numbers differ between the two functions for a few reasons

# mem_used() includes objects created by R but not by the R interpreter

# R and OS do not reclaim memory until actually needed
# R may still hold on to memory until OS asks for it back

# memory fragmentation - gaps between objects in memory
# created as a result of deleted objects

# 1. Explain why the following code doesnâ€™t create a circular list.
x <- list()
obj_addr(x)
tracemem(x)
x[[1]] <- x
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(x[[1]])

# list is copied on modification, so x points to copy
# and x[[1]] points to original empty list, x before modification

# 2. Wrap the two methods for subtracting medians into two functions,
# then use the bench package to carefully compare their speeds.
# How does performance change as the number of columns increase?

# function for creating random dataframe
create_random_df <- function(nrow, ncol) {
  random_matrix <- matrix(runif(nrow * ncol), nrow = nrow)

subtract_df <- function(x, medians) {
  for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
    x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
  }

}

# subtract medians from list

  x <- as.list(x)
  x <- subtract_df(x, medians)
  list2DF(x)

# execution time is slower when working with data frames directly
# as number of columns increases

# 3. What happens if you attempt to use tracemem() on an environment?
e <- rlang::env()
tracemem(e)

# error is thrown - tracemem is not useful for environment objects
# this is because environment objects are always modified in-place

# Quiz answers

# 1. Use backticks to quote non-syntactic names.
df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)

df$`3` <- df$`1` + df$`2`
df


# 2. y is about 8 MB.
x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x)
obj_size(y)

# 3. a is copied when b is modified.
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
tracemem(a)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10
