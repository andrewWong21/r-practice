# 1. What are the four common types of atomic vectors?
# What are the two rare types?

# 2. What are attributes? How do you get them and set them?

# 3. How is a list different from an atomic vector?
# How is a matrix different from a data frame?

# 4. Can you have a list that is a matrix?
# Can a data frame have a column that is a matrix?

# 5. How do tibbles behave differently from data frames?

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# two flavors of vectors: atomic vectors and lists
# elements of atomic vectors must all be of the same type
# lists may contain different types of elements

# NULL is closely related to vectors, often used as generic zero-length vector

# vectors can have attributes - dimension and class
# dimensions turns vectors into matrices and arrays
# classes are used by S3 object system

# atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, character

# attributes work as R's flexible metadata specification
